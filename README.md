# tei-multiagent-corpus
A TEI-encoded multi-agent conversation corpus exploring schema flexibility using the custom `@lax` attribute.

---

## Overview

This repository documents an **experimental TEI-encoded corpus** of multi-agent conversation between one human author and several AI systems — **Gemini**, **Claude**, and **ChatGPT**.  

The project explores:

- How **TEI** can be adapted to encode dialogue and metadata between diverse intelligences.  
- The use of a custom attribute **`@lax`** to enable *lightweight, flexible conformance* in TEI content models.  
- Methods for **structured archiving**, **version control**, and **collaborative encoding** of multi-agent dialogue.  

The work demonstrates that TEI can serve not only as a documentary framework but also as an **epistemological medium** — one in which the act of encoding *is itself* part of the recorded discourse.
