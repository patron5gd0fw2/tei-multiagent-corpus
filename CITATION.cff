abstract: >
  An experimental TEI-encoded corpus documenting structured multi-agent dialogue between a human author and several AI systems (Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT). The project explores schema flexibility through a custom `lax` attribute and demonstrates TEI as a framework for recording, encoding, and studying humanâ€“AI conversation.
